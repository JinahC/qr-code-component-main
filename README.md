- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts


### What I learned

I learned how to compile SCSS files from the command line. In college, I was taught to use a GUI SASS complier called Koala (which I just found out production on the application has stopped).

I looked at [SASS Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#preprocessing) and saw that you can use SASS from the command line. I never knew that. And now it's something that I will never forget as I continue building these projects.

This line of code allowed me to compile files in the `scss` folder into CSS files in the `css` folder. The `--watch` flag makes it so that the files are complied each time they are saved. Very handy.
```bash
sass --watch scss:css
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/sass_import.php) - This helped me remember how to include partials in my SASS files. 
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This was useful for learning how to install SASS and compile SASS via the command line.
